		<p>when linking images to a webpage you can either link to an image on a website using the image address or you 
		can link from an image stored locally. Linking from another website is generally seen as bad practice as the image is 
		not under your controll e.g. the other website might remove or change the image and that will effect your page </p>
		
		<h3>the tag to show this image locally is called &lt;img src="localimageaddress.jpg" /&gt;</h3>
		<h3>the address you use is relative it will be relative to the html file</h3>
		<img src="vmask.jpg" />
